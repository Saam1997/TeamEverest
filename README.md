### EV Charging Station
The project aims to find the nearest charging station for the electric vehicles using the google API and Alternative Fueling Station Locator API.The project will help to make a cleaner transportation system for tomorrow.


The Application shows you a big map of charging stations which will let you filter stations based on things like plug type, location -city,state,price type,phone number, charging network, and more. That means that we can see only stations that support our carâ€™s charging type.
